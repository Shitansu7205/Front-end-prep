1. Scope of varialbe (let var const)
2.Hoisting- For var its working but in the let and const its not working  same as in the function  , the simple function is working with the hoaiting where as the function expression is not wokign .
3.Lexical Scopping - All inner function have the access to the values of outer function
  && Clouser - a closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
4.Event Lopping- Js workes on a single threate in the oder of . Synchronous > Function Calls> Microtasks > Macrotasks
5.Debouncing & Throttling (Knowing only Concept)
6.REST and SPREAD Operator - -Both syantax(...)
                        REST - pack the values in to a single unit.
                        SPREAD  - Unpack the values/spread the values.
7.Promises and async and await 
8.Array  -- Is used to stored the eleneten in a single variablle(May be diffrent datatype).. Array are mutable (can be change)
            methods - push() → add to end
                      pop() → remove from end
                      shift() → remove from start
                      unshift() → add to start
                      splice(start, deleteCount, ...items) → add/remove at specific index
                      reverse() → reverses array
                      slice(start, end) → extract subarray (doesn’t change original)
                      join(" ") → join the values in to a string(Separated by "  ,  " , " " , " - ")
                      indexOf(item) → index of first match (or -1) 
                      lastIndexOf(item) → last match index
                      includes(item) → true/false
                      flat()→ flatten nested arrays into a single array.  [ [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6] ];
                      sort((a,b)=>a-b) → accending and desecing order (chnage the original array) 
                      arr1.concate(arr2) → Merge the array
